========================================================

This presentation is meant to fulfill the final project for the "Developing Data Products" course by Coursera. I will present two interactive graphics with simple show/no show options for comparison purposes. The intention is to show the difference between two sampling examples:

- The first graph comes from independent random values, using R function "rnorm" with default values (mean zero and standard deviation 1).
- The second graph is fed with the the same range of numbers, but not necessarily independent (out of a pool of 1,000 numbers).
